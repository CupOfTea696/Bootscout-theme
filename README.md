## Bootscout
Bootscout is a WordPress theme using twitter-bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6. It has been styled for scout websites.

### Base theme
The base theme can be found here: http://simonpadbury.github.io. I used this as a starting point and build it up to the current state of the project.

### Current development
Currently the theme works and has some useful functionality. this includes:
* Colours and text are inline with the scout association style guidelines
* A logo can be set to appear in the top left had side of each page
* Two menus can be set at any one time (one as the navbar and one as extra information in the footer)
* Various page templates have been created to make editing the site easier
* theme options have been created to set useful information about the scout group / district / county
* (WIP)a carousel can be displayed on the front page displaying recent posts

### Setting up the theme
1. Download the latest release (keep it in .zip format)
2. Within your WP site upload the zip in the theme options. Activate the theme once complete
3. In your WP dashboard navigate to theme options which is located in appearance
4. fill in all fields that apply and save changes
5. Also with the appearance tab go to customize.
6. set a site logo from within the site identity options and site icon, set your menus in the menus options (you will need to make the pages first).

### Page templates
* Default: includes page title and sidebar
* Contact: Includes page title, social media links if set and sidebar
* Banner: Includes page title, banner image (set a featured image for the page to display)
* No title: just a plain page
* Section page: Display links to various scout sections if set (can set sections in theme options)
